<h3>Independent JPEG Group License</h3>
LEGAL ISSUES<br/>
<br/>
In plain English:<br/>
<br/>
1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) <br/>
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us. <br/>
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.<br/>
<br/>
In legalese:<br/>
<br/>
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.<br/>
<br/>
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. <br/>
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". <br/>
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.<br/>
<br/>
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".<br/>
<br/>
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.<br/>
<br/>
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.<br/>
<br/>
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.<br/>
<br/>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.<br/>
<br/>
We are required to state that <br/>
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated." <br/>

<h3>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br/>
<br/>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org><br/>
<br/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br/>
<br/>
0. Additional Definitions.<br/>
<br/>
As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br/>
<br/>
An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.<br/>
<br/>
A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked Version&rdquo;.<br/>
<br/>
The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br/>
<br/>
The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br/>
<br/>
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/>
<br/>
2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br/>
<br/>
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:<br/>
  * a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br/>
  * b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.<br/>
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br/>
<br/>
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br/>
  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<br/>
  * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>
4. Combined Works.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:<br/>
  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<br/>
  * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>
  * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/>
  * d) Do one of the following:<br/>
    * 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.<br/>
    * 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.<br/>
  * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br/>
5. Combined Libraries.<br/>
<br/>
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br/>
  * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.<br/>
  * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/>
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.<br/>
